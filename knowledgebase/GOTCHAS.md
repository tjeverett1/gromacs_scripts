# Known gotchas — detailed reference

Pitfalls discovered in this environment, with the full explanation and fix for each. The
compact **index** (one line per gotcha, phrased as the trigger) lives in `CLAUDE.md` under
"Known gotchas" — that's the always-loaded tripwire; this file is the detail you open when a
tripwire fires. **When you discover a new pitfall: append the detail here AND add a one-line
entry to the index in `CLAUDE.md`** — both, every time, or the tripwire is invisible / the
detail is lost. The goal is that the same mistake is never made twice.

### SLURM: sbatch scripts are copied to a temp path at execution time

SLURM copies the `.sbatch` script to a temporary location before running it, so `BASH_SOURCE[0]` inside an sbatch script does not point to the repo. Code like `$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../site_config.sh` will silently resolve to the wrong place or fail.

**Fix (two options):**
- Use `$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR` — a SLURM-provided environment variable that always holds the directory from which `sbatch` was called. Works as long as the job is submitted from the repo root (the normal case).
- Or pass the repo path explicitly via `--export` (e.g. `GROMACS_SCRIPTS_DIR`) and use that variable inside the sbatch.

Regular shell scripts called from *outside* SLURM (e.g. `scripts/analysis/`) can use `BASH_SOURCE[0]` reliably.

### GROMACS: `-pbc nojump` breaks T-REMD trajectories

`nojump` works by comparing consecutive frames to detect box-boundary crossings. T-REMD coordinate exchanges cause discontinuous jumps between frames that `nojump` misinterprets and incorrectly "fixes."

**Fix:** use `-pbc mol` instead. It is a per-frame operation and is safe for REMD trajectories.

### GROMACS: `gmx trjconv -s` must match the XTC atom count exactly

If the structure passed to `-s` has fewer atoms than the XTC (e.g. a protein-only GRO when the XTC has the full solvated system), GROMACS silently truncates the read, produces a degenerate fitting matrix, and dies with `Too many iterations in routine JACOBI`.

**Fix:** always use a full-system GRO (matching the XTC) as `-s`. Extract a separate protein-only GRO if needed for downstream analysis.

### GROMACS: a CUDA "illegal memory access" (#700) is usually a physics blow-up, not a GPU fault

When a fully GPU-resident run (`-nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu`, single rank → GPU-resident update) dies at step 0 with `CUDA error #700 (cudaErrorIllegalAddress)` — often surfacing as an assertion in `freeDeviceBuffer`/`cudaStreamQuery` — the GPU is rarely the real problem. A numerical explosion (overlapping atoms → NaN coordinates → out-of-bounds pairlist) manifests as an illegal memory access on the GPU instead of a clean error.

**Fix:** re-run the *same tpr* with `-nb cpu`. The CPU path prints the real diagnosis — e.g. `Constraint error in algorithm Lincs at step 0` plus an energy table showing a huge **positive** `LJ (SR)` and absurd temperature/pressure (clashes). Then fix the physics (usually a bad starting structure), not the GPU flags. In one case the culprit was the heat-stage `grompp` reading the *un-minimized* `build/*_ions.gro` instead of `em/em.gro`, discarding EM and starting on clashing coordinates. Always confirm each equilibration `grompp -c` consumes the *previous* stage's output (MD: em.gro → heat.gro → density_seg*.gro → [relax.gro] → prod; REMD: em.gro → density_seg*.gro → equil.gro → prod), not the build.

### GROMACS: a fixed `SEED` reproduces the setup, NOT a bit-for-bit GPU trajectory

The pipeline takes a `SEED` job parameter (default `-1` = random per run, i.e. legacy behaviour; `>= 0` pins it). When set it fills `gen-seed` (velocity generation), `ld-seed` (the **stochastic** `V-rescale` thermostat *and* `C-rescale` barostat draw from it — not just Langevin/SD integrators), and `mdrun -reseed` (the replica-exchange RNG, counter-based on `(seed, step)`). Per-replica stages offset the base as `SEED + i` (via the `rep_seed` helper) so replicas stay decorrelated; single-sim stages (MD `heat`, `density`) use `SEED` directly. `REMD-restart.sbatch` recovers `-reseed` from the original `mdrun_remd.log` so a seeded run resumes reproducibly.

**Do not promise bitwise reproducibility.** These are GPU-resident runs (`-nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu`); GROMACS does floating-point reductions in a nondeterministic order on GPU (and under domain decomposition), so two same-seed runs on the same hardware still diverge within a few ps — MD is chaotic. What a fixed seed *does* guarantee: identical initial velocities and identical RNG streams, i.e. reproducible **initial conditions and setup** (useful for variant comparison starting from the same thermal kick) and full provenance in `parameters.txt`. Bitwise determinism would require `-nb cpu -pme cpu` single-rank — far too slow to be worth it here. Adding a seed to a new mdp block means BOTH `gen-seed` (if `gen-vel = yes`) and `ld-seed` (any V-rescale/C-rescale block); `SEED` is a shared param, so it lives in all three `validate_params.py` lists + each engine's STEP-1 read/export (see the STEP-1 validation gotcha).

### Bash: `bash -n` does not catch `set -u` unbound variables — grep removed vars when refactoring

The sbatch engines run `set -euo pipefail`. A reference to a variable that was never assigned (e.g. left dangling after you delete the block that defined it) is a **runtime** crash — `line N: VAR: unbound variable` — that `bash -n` (syntax-only) passes clean. This bit us once: refactoring the MD post-analysis step removed `ANALYSIS_DIR=...`, but the STEP 11 summary still echoed `${ANALYSIS_DIR}`, so the job ran to completion and then died on the last summary line.

**Fix:** when you remove or rename a variable's assignment, `grep -n 'VARNAME' the_script` and confirm there are no remaining references (or none beyond the assignment). Don't rely on `bash -n`; it won't flag this. (Note the failure surfaces *after* the real work — the analysis had already run — so a late summary crash does not mean the outputs are missing.)

### GROMACS: `-pbc mol`/`-pbc whole` split multi-chain complexes — multi-chain has its own pipeline

For a multi-chain complex, `-pbc mol` wraps each chain's COM into the box *independently*, and `-pbc whole` only un-breaks within a molecule — neither keeps the two chains in the *same* periodic image. So a bound complex can end up with one chain a box-vector away ("split"), which: inflates the whole-complex RMSD against a split reference (one case: median backbone RMSD 24.5 Å, while Rg stayed ~1.4 nm — the giveaway that it's a relative-image artifact, not real motion), and biases Rg/RMSF. Whether it splits is frame-dependent, so the trajectory flickers between intact and split.

**Architecture:** the **single-chain** analysis path is left simple — `fix_PBC.sh` uses `-pbc mol` and `extract_protein.sh` uses `-pbc whole`. **Multi-chain** systems are handled by a **separate `multichain_*` pipeline** that `run_analysis.sh` selects automatically when the topology has >1 protein chain. Those scripts apply the **`-pbc cluster`** periodic-image fix (cluster group = `Protein`), which pulls all chains into one image and is per-frame → REMD-safe (unlike `nojump`). **Note:** `-pbc cluster` is a PBC operation; it is unrelated to *conformational* clustering (`gmx cluster`) — the scripts are named `multichain_*`, never `*cluster*`, to avoid that confusion.

**Caveat:** `-pbc cluster` assumes the complex stays within ~half the (minimum) box vector. Beyond that the periodic image is genuinely ambiguous *and* the box is too small (minimum-image violation → corrupt physics), so it is a setup red flag, not just an analysis issue. The multi-chain pipeline emits an inter-chain minimum-distance curve (`gmx mindist`, minimum-image-aware) so you can confirm the complex stayed bound; for genuine dissociation studies use a bigger box.

### GROMACS: `gmx rms` does not make its reference whole — a PBC-broken reference inflates RMSD

`gmx rms -s REF -f TRAJ` least-squares-fits *every frame* onto REF before measuring, so the reference does **not** need to be pre-aligned to the trajectory (the fit is internal and per-frame). But `gmx rms` does **not** apply any PBC treatment to REF. If the reference structure (e.g. a protein extracted straight from `em.gro`) has the molecule split across a box boundary, the reference coordinates are physically wrong and *every* RMSD value is silently corrupted — typically showing an absurd, near-constant offset. In one example this inflated the t=0 backbone RMSD to ~13 Å; with a whole reference the same trajectory read a physical ~3 Å.

**Fix:** make the reference whole when extracting it — `trjconv -s system.tpr -pbc whole`. `extract_protein.sh` does this. It is a no-op if the molecule was already intact, so it is safe to always apply. (Note: a near-constant, physically-impossible RMSD that does *not* start at ~0 is the signature of this bug, not of real drift.)

### GROMACS: distances are nm — convert to Å for analysis plots

`gmx rms`, `gmx gyrate`, and `gmx rmsf` all write distances in **nm**; structural work expects ångström. `gromd-plot-xvg` converts any axis whose `.xvg` label carries an `nm` unit to Å (×10, label rewritten), leaving the underlying `.xvg` data in nm. If you add a new distance metric, confirm its plot reads in Å.

### GROMACS: `gmx demux` is not for extracting constant-T ensembles

`gmx demux` reconstructs the trajectory of a single *configuration* as it walks through temperature space. It does not produce the thermodynamic ensemble at a given temperature.

**Fix:** use the slot trajectory directly. `prod/rep000/remd.xtc` is already the 300 K constant-temperature ensemble — no post-processing needed to obtain it.

### GROMACS: REMD acceptance rates are pre-computed in the log

The `Replica exchange statistics` block at the end of each replica log contains pre-computed per-pair acceptance rates, exchange counts, and mean Metropolis probabilities. Reparsing the thousands of per-frame `Repl ex` lines to recount exchanges is unnecessary.

**Fix:** parse the statistics block at the end of the log. See `scripts/analysis/REMD_log_reference.md` for the format and parsing code.

### GROMACS: the Empirical Transition Matrix is not dwell time

The matrix printed after the statistics block records one-step transition *probabilities* between temperature slots. It is not a histogram of time spent at each temperature.

### GROMACS: this build provides only `gmx_mpi` — there is no `gmx` or `gmx mdrun`

The install (`$HOME/opt/gromacs/2024.3-plumed/bin/`) ships a single binary, `gmx_mpi`. There is no plain `gmx`, so `gmx mdrun` does not exist. All commands — preprocessing *and* mdrun — must use `gmx_mpi`. An MPI-compiled GROMACS runs serial steps fine as a single rank with no `mpirun` (this is how the REMD engine runs EM/density); only multi-replica steps need `mpirun -np N`.

**Fix:** use the `GMX="${GMX:-gmx_mpi}"` pattern and call `$GMX mdrun` everywhere. (Both engines previously carried a dead `MDRUN="gmx mdrun"` variable that was never used and would fail here — it has been removed; don't reintroduce it.) The analysis scripts already probe `gmx_mpi` first, then fall back to `gmx`.

### GROMACS: conformational clustering uses sklearn (`gromd-cluster`), not `gmx cluster`

`gmx cluster` (gromos) builds the full pairwise-RMSD matrix → **O(N²)** in time and memory, which is impractical for the long production runs (25k+ frames). Conformational clustering is therefore done in `gromd_analysis/clustering.py` (the `gromd-cluster` entry point) (MDAnalysis + scikit-learn DBSCAN/k-means on flattened Cα coordinates), which scales: a 25k-frame run clusters in ~13 s. It runs in the **shared** part of `run_analysis.sh` (consumes `<prefix>_stripped_aligned.{xtc,gro}`), so it serves single- and multi-chain alike — no `multichain_*` variant.

Things to keep straight:
- **`--cutoff` is a real RMSD cutoff (nm)** only because the input frames are pre-aligned to one common reference, so flattened-coord Euclidean distance = `√N_atoms × RMSD`. The script sets DBSCAN `eps = cutoff_Å × √N_selected`. **If you ever feed `gromd-cluster` an un-aligned trajectory, the cutoff stops meaning RMSD.** (This was a latent bug in the Amber `cluster_MD.py`, where `eps` was a raw flattened distance mislabelled "Å".)
- **Cluster count vs noise is controlled by `min_samples`** (the DBSCAN density knob), **not** a post-hoc population filter — the user rejected adding one. The default is **adaptive: `max(10, 1.5% of frames)`**, so a region must hold ~1.5% of the trajectory to be a state and the long tail of tiny clusters falls into noise (without it, a flexible system gave 80 clusters). Raise `--min-samples` for fewer; pass an absolute int to override. Tuned on the WW-domain REMD slots to keep even the most heterogeneous case to ≲10 clusters.
- **Outputs go in a `clustering/` subdir** next to the prefix (`analysis/clustering/<prefix>_cluster_*`), not flat in `analysis/`.
- **`-pbc cluster`** (the multi-chain periodic-image fix) is **unrelated** to this conformational clustering — different operation, despite the shared word. The multichain PBC scripts are deliberately not named `*cluster*`.

### Per-job parameters are validated at STEP 1 (fail loud, not silent default)

Both engines call `scripts/simulation/validate_params.py` (`--engine remd|md`) in STEP 1: once with `--check-keys "$1"` *before* sourcing a config file (rejects typo'd keys against an allowlist), then once on the resolved values (required `PDB_IN`, type, range — covers both config-file and `--export` params). A bad parameter now exits with `[ERROR] …` instead of silently using a `${VAR:-default}`. `PDB_IN` is **required** (no default).

Things to keep straight when touching parameters:
- **Three lists must stay in sync** when you add/rename a param: the `${VAR:-default}` read in the engine's STEP 1, the `export …` list right before the `python3 "$VALIDATE_PARAMS"` call (so the validator can read it from the environment), and the allowlist + rules in `validate_params.py`. A param missing from the export list is silently unvalidated; one missing from the allowlist is falsely rejected as a typo.
- **`validate_params.py` is stdlib-only** — it runs under the sbatch's *system* `python3` at STEP 1, before the analysis conda env is activated. Don't add non-stdlib imports.
- **Derived step counts** (`*_NSTEPS`, `TAU_T`, `REPLEX_STEPS`) are computed **after** the validator on purpose, so a non-numeric input fails with a clear message instead of a raw traceback from the inline `python3 -c`. Keep new derivations below the validate call.
- **Typo'd-key detection is config-file only.** Under `--export=ALL` the job inherits the whole shell environment, so there's no clean manifest to flag an unknown `--export` key against — only value/required/range checks cover that path (by design).

### GROMACS: short `REPLEX_PS` (<1 ps) deadlocks GPU-resident REMD — keep it ≥ 1 ps

On GPU-resident REMD production (`-nb/-pme/-bonded gpu`, GPU update, many ranks/GPU — e.g. 48 ranks on 4 L40S), `REPLEX_PS=0.5` (exchange every 250 steps @ 2 fs) reliably **hangs mid-run**: CPUs at 100%, GPUs at 0%, indefinitely. Signature: *all* replicas frozen at the *same* exchange step with **clean physics** (`Constr. rmsd = 0`, no LINCS/NaN) — an **MPI collective deadlock at exchange**, not a blow-up (contrast the CUDA #700 gotcha). Cause: each accepted swap moves GPU-resident coordinates via GPU↔CPU transfers + stream syncs; at 250-step spacing consecutive swaps' stream work overlaps and races. It's a **threshold, not linear**: the *same* config at `REPLEX_PS=1.0` never hangs — interval was the only change.

**Fix:** keep **`REPLEX_PS ≥ 1.0`** (1–2 ps is standard and sub-ps buys no extra sampling). Only if sub-ps exchange were truly required, add **`-update cpu`** to the STEP 9 `mdrun` (moves the swap off the GPU) at ~10–25% throughput cost. **Both engine defaults are `1.0`** (REMD's was raised from `0.5` on 2026-09-02, along with `scripts/simulation/config_example.sh`), so a job now has to lower it deliberately.

### SLURM/GROMACS: `gmx_mpi` needs `libhcoll`/`libocoms` — missing on some `mit_normal_gpu` nodes; also constrain to `rocky8`

The `gmx_mpi` binary (`~/opt/gromacs/2024.3-plumed`) carries a **baked-in `NEEDED` on `libhcoll.so.1` and `libocoms.so.0`** (from `/opt/mellanox/hcoll/lib`), left over from its build-time MPI. These are **inert at runtime** — the loaded `openmpi/5.0.8` module is built `--without-hcoll`, so MPI actually routes through `libmpi.so.40` — but the loader still has to *resolve* them at exec. `/opt/mellanox` is **node-local**, and some `mit_normal_gpu` nodes (seen on node4207) don't have it, so the job dies **instantly** with `gmx_mpi: error while loading shared libraries: libhcoll.so.1: cannot open shared object file`. On `pi_keating` (and the login node) it resolves via `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/hcoll.conf`, which is why REMD there never hit this.

**Fix (two parts):**
- **Stage the two libs on shared storage and prepend `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`** in the job, *after* sourcing GMXRC: copy `libhcoll.so.1{,.0.9}` + `libocoms.so.0{,.0.0}` from `/opt/mellanox/hcoll/lib` to a shared dir, then `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<that dir>:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-}"`. Their transitive deps are all standard RDMA/system libs (`libibverbs`, `librdmacm`, `libnl`, …) present on any IB node, so no rabbit hole.
- **Add `#SBATCH -C rocky8`.** The binary is built on Rocky 8 (login node = Rocky 8.10, el8); landing on a non-rocky8 node would be a real glibc/ABI mismatch. All `mit_normal_gpu` nodes are rocky8 today, so this is future-proofing, not a live bug. (Discovered while smoke-testing the REST2 `-hrex` engine on `mit_normal_gpu`; see `knowledgebase/plans/REST2-pipeline.md`.)

### PLUMED/GROMACS: `-hrex` (REST2 Hamiltonian exchange) is SILENTLY BROKEN on the `2024.3-plumed_2.9.4` build

The current build (**GROMACS 2024.3 + PLUMED 2.9.4**) accepts `-hrex`, patches cleanly, loads PLUMED ("GROMACS-like replica exchange is on"), and *runs to completion* — but **every exchange has `dE_term = 0.000e+00` and zero replicas ever swap.** So a REST2 run would look successful while actually being N independent MD runs with no enhanced sampling — a silent-wrong result. Verified 2026-07-29 on both CPU and GPU with correctly-scaled `partial_tempering` topologies (the scaling itself is fine; `scale=1.0` reproduces the FF to the bit). Root cause: the PLUMED **2.9.x** hrex patch for **GROMACS 2024.x** is an incomplete port — `md.cpp`'s `GREX cacheLocalUSwap` energy re-evaluation returns a wrong value on the 2024 force API, so `replicaexchange.cpp`'s `if(plumed_hrex) delta=0.0` is never corrected by a real Hamiltonian delta. Confirmed authoritatively by PLUMED developer **Giovanni Bussi** on the plumed-users list: **"hrex is not yet supported in the 2024 patch"** — i.e. the `gromacs-2024.3` patch exists and supports general PLUMED use (biasing/metadynamics), but the hrex energy machinery was never ported to it. Corroborated by GROMACS forum + PLUMED GitHub issue #1326 (open as of Oct 2025, no fix). Per Bussi, **GROMACS 2023 is the newest GROMACS with working PLUMED hrex** — this is not an arbitrary downgrade. The only confirmed-working combo is **GROMACS 2023.5 + PLUMED 2.9.x** (scale-1.0 sanity check gives P=1.0 there); GROMACS 2025 + PLUMED 2.10 has a new *native* interface but is unverified for hrex.

**Fix:** do NOT ship a REST2 pipeline against this build. Rebuild a GROMACS+PLUMED with a working hrex patch first, and **gate the REST2 engine on an acceptance-rate self-check** (assert nonzero exchanges in a short pre-run, fail loud) so a regression can never silently produce a fake REST2. Plain T-REMD and MD on `2024.3-plumed_2.9.4` are unaffected (they don't use `-hrex`). See `knowledgebase/plans/REST2-pipeline.md`.

### PLUMED: the `plumed` CLI needs the hcoll libs too (same fix as `gmx_mpi`)

The standalone `plumed` CLI (`plumed info`, `plumed patch`, `plumed partial_tempering`) links **the exact same `libhcoll.so.1` / `libocoms.so.0`** as `gmx_mpi`, so it dies the same way on GPU nodes lacking `/opt/mellanox/hcoll`: `plumed: error while loading shared libraries: libhcoll.so.1`. (Confusingly, the plumed *kernel* `libplumedKernel.so` loads fine at `mdrun -plumed` time on those nodes — it's only the CLI binary that's affected.)

**Fix:** the same `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HCOLL_COMPAT_DIR:…"` staging that fixes `gmx_mpi`. The REST2 engine sets it before STEP 6, so `plumed partial_tempering` runs inline on the compute node — no need to pre-generate topologies elsewhere. **Exception — the GROMACS build:** `install_gromacs-2023.5-plumed.sh` does NOT set the hcoll path during the compile job, so it instead requires the source to be **pre-patched on the login node** (`plumed patch -p -e gromacs-<ver>`); the runtime/"shared" patch is only needed at patch time, not compile time, so cmake/make/install then run fine on the compute node against the pre-patched source (the script checks for `.preplumed` backups and errors with instructions otherwise).

### GROMACS/SLURM: compile on the same (or older) CPU microarch as the run nodes — SIMD/`-march` is baked into the binary

GROMACS auto-detects the **build node's** CPU at configure time and bakes its SIMD level + compiler `-march` into the binary (our builds: `-march=skylake-avx512`, `SIMD = AVX_512`). Run that binary on a node whose CPU **lacks** an instruction it was compiled with and it dies with **"illegal instruction"** (or GROMACS refuses at startup on a SIMD mismatch). This cluster is heterogeneous: the `pi_keating` build nodes **node[3619-3620]** are Skylake-AVX512, while `mit_normal_gpu` mixes L40S/H100/H200 hosts, some on newer microarchs (e.g. Sapphire Rapids). Building on a newer node and running on `node[3619-3620]` is the dangerous direction.

**Fix:** build on **node[3619-3620]** (`-p pi_keating --nodelist=node[3619-3620]`), OR build anywhere and force the target with `-DGMX_SIMD=AVX_512 -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-march=skylake-avx512 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-march=skylake-avx512` (what `install_gromacs-2023.5-plumed.sh` does, so it can build on a free node yet stay portable).

### GROMACS: `OUTDIR` must be on the same filesystem as the submit directory (solvate/genion topology rename)

`gmx solvate` / `gmx genion` update the topology by writing a temp file (`temp.topXXXXXX`) **in the current working directory** and then `rename()`-ing it to the `-p` path. `rename(2)` cannot cross filesystems, so if `OUTDIR/build/` is on a *different* mount than the job's CWD (= `SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR`), the build dies at STEP 3 with a cryptic `System I/O error: Failed to rename temp.top... to .../<name>.top` (and leaves the topology missing, only a `#...top.1#` backup). This bit the REST2 engine test when `OUTDIR` was set to `/orcd/data/keating/...` while submitting from `/orcd/pool/004/...` — two different mounts. Affects all engines (REMD/MD/REST2), not just REST2.

**Fix:** keep `OUTDIR` on the **same filesystem** as where you `sbatch` from (the normal case — `OUTDIR` under the repo, submitted from the repo). Trajectories still go to `SCRATCH_ROOT` on any filesystem (those are written directly / via symlink, not renamed). A Skylake-AVX512 binary runs on both those nodes *and* the newer `mit_normal_gpu` nodes (a newer CPU is a superset), so building on the *oldest* target microarch is portable everywhere; the reverse is not. If you must build on a newer node but run on Skylake, pin `-DGMX_SIMD=AVX_512` **and** the compiler arch (`-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-march=skylake-avx512`, same for CXX). (Surfaced building the REST2 GROMACS 2023.5; the 2024.3 build already lived on node[3619-3620].)

### Bash/GROMACS: `VAR=$(cmd | grep -c ...)` under `set -e` silently kills the job when `cmd` fails to launch

The REST2 engine's STEP 0 hrex probe was `_HREX_OK=$("$GMX" mdrun -h 2>&1 | grep -ci 'hrex')`. Two failure modes compound: (1) if `gmx_mpi` **can't run at all** on the compute node (bad MPI/CUDA/library env), its real error is redirected by `2>&1` **into the pipe** and swallowed by `grep`; (2) `grep -c` then finds zero matches and **exits 1**, which — because it's the command substitution in an assignment — trips `set -e` and exits the whole script. Net result: the job dies in ~6 s having printed **only** `===== JOB START =====`, with an **empty** stderr and exit code 1 — a maximally uninformative failure (the `set +o pipefail` around it guards SIGPIPE from `grep -q`, but does nothing for the zero-match case). Seen 2026-07-29: a REST2 test on `pi_keating` node1927 failed exactly this way; the same binary/env ran clean on other rocky8 nodes (16-task allocation, GPUs) — i.e. the underlying `gmx_mpi` fault was **node-specific/transient**, but the engine hid it completely.

**Fix (applied):** never let a launch failure hide inside a `| grep` under `set -e`. Run the probe once, capturing output **and** exit code with `set -e` disabled around it, check the exit code explicitly, and **print the binary's real output** before exiting if it's nonzero — only then grep the captured text for the feature. Pattern:
```bash
set +e; _HELP="$("$GMX" mdrun -h 2>&1)"; _RC=$?; set -e
(( _RC == 0 )) || { echo "[ERROR] '$GMX mdrun -h' exited $_RC — binary could not run:"; echo "$_HELP"; exit 1; }
grep -qi 'hrex' <<<"$_HELP" || { echo "[ERROR] no -hrex in this build"; exit 1; }
```
General rule: a `VAR=$(... | grep -c/-q ...)` whose upstream command can fail to execute is a silent-death trap under `set -e`; separate "did it run?" from "what did it say?".

### Output model: folder-symlink stages — don't symlink `build/`, and don't copy the symlinks

The engines write the **bulk stage dirs** (`heat/ density/ equil/ prod/` for REMD/REST2, `heat/ density/ [relax/] prod/` for MD) as **folder symlinks** `${OUTDIR}/<stage> → ${SCRATCH_DIR}/<stage>`, pre-created *before* mdrun so trajectories land on scratch without touching the pool (default `SYMLINK_BULK=1`; `SYMLINK_BULK=0` makes them real in `OUTDIR`). The transparency is the whole point — every stage-dir variable still reads `${OUTDIR}/<stage>`, so mdrun/grompp/analysis paths are unchanged. Three traps to keep in mind:

- **Never symlink `build/`** (or `em/`). `build/` must be **real in `OUTDIR`** or the `solvate`/`genion` topology `rename()` becomes cross-filesystem and dies (see the OUTDIR gotcha above). It's small; keep it real.
- **The stage symlink must PRE-EXIST before mdrun**, created in the tree-setup block. If a later step does `mkdir -p "$STAGE_DIR"` on a path that isn't already the symlink, it creates a *real* dir in OUTDIR and the bulk lands on the pool. (MD's optional `relax/` is created the same conditional way inside STEP 6.)
- **`finalize_outputs.sh` must skip symlinks.** It copies the real OUTDIR dirs into `SCRATCH_DIR` to make the archive self-contained; it explicitly `continue`s on any entry that is a symlink (`[[ -L ]]`), because copying `prod/` (which points back into `SCRATCH_DIR`) would recurse/duplicate. A plain `cp -a prod scratch/` would also nest as `scratch/prod/prod`.

**Fix / rule:** when touching the output tree, preserve these invariants — real `build/ em/ analysis/ logs/` (+ REST2 `topol/`), symlinked bulk stages created up front, and a symlink-skipping finalize. Recovering `SCRATCH_DIR` from a finished run (e.g. the restart engine): `SCRATCH_DIR="$(dirname "$(readlink -f "${OUTDIR}/prod")")"` when `prod/` is a symlink.

### GROMACS: CHARMM force fields REQUIRE force-switched vdW — plain-cutoff mdp silently gives wrong energetics

The engines' mdp nonbonded block is AMBER-style: `rvdw = rcoulomb = CUTOFF_NM` (1.0 nm) plain Verlet cutoff + `DispCorr = EnerPres`. CHARMM36/36m was **parameterized with force-switched van der Waals** (`vdw-modifier = force-switch`, `rvdw-switch = 1.0`, `rvdw = rcoulomb = 1.2 nm`) and **no analytic dispersion correction** (`DispCorr = no` — the force-switch already handles the vdW tail; adding DispCorr double-counts). Running CHARMM with the AMBER cutoff settings *runs fine and looks plausible* but produces subtly wrong forces/energies — the classic silent-bad-result failure. Equally, pairing CHARMM protein with plain TIP3P (or AMBER protein with the CHARMM-modified TIP3P) is wrong: each force field is validated only with its matched water. In the GROMACS CHARMM port, `pdb2gmx -water tip3p` resolves to the **CHARMM-modified TIP3P automatically** (it reads `<ff>.ff/tip3p.itp`, i.e. the LJ-on-H variant), so water follows the force field for free — never force plain TIP3P onto CHARMM.

**Fix (applied):** all three engines gate the nonbonded mdp lines on `[[ $FF == charmm* ]]` — CHARMM emits the force-switch block + `DispCorr=no` and forces `CUTOFF_NM=1.2` (with an `[INFO]` override notice); the AMBER branch (`VDW_BLOCK=""`) leaves the generated mdp **byte-identical** to before, so existing amber runs are unchanged. The CHARMM36m force field itself is not bundled with GROMACS (only `charmm27.ff` is) — it's the MacKerell **force-switch** port (`charmm36-feb2026_cgenff-5.0`) installed under `$HOME/opt/gromacs/ff/` and found via `export GMXLIB` in `site_config.sh` (searched in addition to each build's bundled `top/`, so amber keeps working). **Do NOT use the `ljpme` port** with these force-switch settings — LJ-PME needs `vdwtype = PME` + a different mdp path. Select per job with `FF=charmm36-feb2026_cgenff-5.0` (keep `WATER=tip3p`). Verified: pdb2gmx builds the topology ("The Charmm36m force field and the tip3p water model are used") and grompp accepts the force-switch tpr.

**Keep the upstream dated directory name.** The port was briefly installed here as `charmm36m.ff`, which is *not* how these ports are distributed — every release ships a dated directory (`charmm36-jul2022.ff`, `charmm36-feb2026_cgenff-5.0.ff`, …) and you pass that name to `pdb2gmx -ff`. Renaming to a generic `charmm36m` reads better in a submit script but makes `parameters.txt` record `FF=charmm36m` forever, so two runs a year apart log an identical string while a newer port has been dropped into the same directory — an invisible force-field change in a pipeline whose purpose is comparing variants. The mdp gate is a `charmm*` glob, so the dated name needs no code change. (The port's own provenance survives inside `forcefield.itp`'s header — charmm2gmx version + build date — but that describes the directory's *current* contents, not what a past job used.) For usability, `site_config.sh` maps short names to installed ports (`FF_ALIASES`, e.g. `charmm36m`); the engines resolve the alias at STEP 1 via `resolve_ff` and record the **resolved dated name** in `parameters.txt`, so the short name is input sugar only and never reaches the run record. An alias whose target is not in `GMXLIB` fails at STEP 1.

### GROMACS: `gmx trjconv` cannot combine `-fit` with `-pbc mol` — they must be separate passes

`trjconv` refuses `-fit` together with any `-pbc` mode other than `none`/`whole`, because a PBC wrap applied after a rotation would re-wrap atoms against a box the coordinates no longer match. This is *why* the analysis layer is split into `fix_PBC.sh` (PBC) and `strip_and_align_trajectory.sh` (fit) rather than one script — the two-script shape is a GROMACS constraint, not a stylistic choice.

**Fix / rule:** any new tool that needs both PBC treatment and alignment must run two `trjconv` calls, PBC first. See `extract_solvated_snapshots.sh` for the pattern.

### GROMACS: `-fit rot+trans` rotates coordinates but NOT the box — never run a PBC-aware selection on a fitted frame

This is the subtle one. `gmx trjconv -fit rot+trans` rewrites the coordinates but leaves the box vectors **byte-identical**. The frame is therefore internally inconsistent: PBC-aware distance code still measures minimum images against the *original* box, which no longer corresponds to the rotated coordinates. Any `gmx select` distance keyword (`within`, `same residue as (within …)`) run on a fitted frame silently returns a **wrong** atom set.

Measured on `example/outputs/output_MD/helix_fusion-2ns-MD-300K-NPT` at t=500 ps with a 0.5 nm shell: selecting on the fitted frame gave **1622** atoms vs **1598** on the same frame pre-fit — 8 spurious waters, the furthest **23 Å** from the protein, which render as water floating in empty space. Nothing errors; the PDB just quietly contains the wrong molecules.

**Fix / rule:** compute the selection on the **PBC-corrected but unfitted** frame, then apply the resulting index to the fitted frame — `-fit` does not renumber atoms, so the index stays valid. Order is **PBC → select → fit → write**. More generally: treat any fitted/rotated frame as having a meaningless box, and never feed one to a distance-based selection or to `gmx mindist`/`gmx select`.

### GROMACS: a solvent-shell selection must come AFTER PBC centering

`gmx select`'s `within` is PBC-aware, so on a raw frame it will select a water whose *periodic image* is near the protein while its stored coordinate sits across the box — written out as a water far from everything. Running `-pbc mol -center -ur compact` first puts the protein at the box centre with all nearest images already in place, so the selected waters are the ones physically drawn next to it.

**Fix / rule:** PBC-correct (and for a complex, `whole → cluster → mol+center+compact`) before any shell selection. Sanity-check the result by measuring the max water→protein distance: it should not exceed the shell by more than ~1 Å (whole-residue selection means a water's O can sit slightly beyond a cutoff satisfied by its H).

### GROMACS: `gmx select` names a selection with a LEADING QUOTED STRING, not `Name =`

`-select 'Shell = group "Protein" or ...'` does **not** name a selection — in the GROMACS selection language `name = expr` declares a reusable *variable*, which is not itself a selection, so the command dies with `Error in user input: Too few selections provided`. The naming syntax is a leading quoted string: `-select '"Shell" group "Protein" or ...'`.

Second trap in the same area: for a **dynamic** selection, `gmx select -on` stamps the frame and time into the group name — `[ Shell ]` is written as `[ Shell_f0_t1000.000 ]`. Selecting that group by name downstream fails. Select it by **index** instead (`printf "0\n" | gmx trjconv ... -n shell.ndx`); one selection over one frame means the ndx holds exactly one group, so `0` is unambiguous.

### GROMACS: do NOT parse `gmx check` for a trajectory's last frame time

Two independent traps, which is why the answer is "use something else entirely":

1. **The output uses carriage returns.** `gmx check -f traj.xtc` draws progress with `\r`, so every `Reading frame … time …` update *and* any final `Last frame  200 time 2000.000` share **one physical line**. `awk '/^Last frame/'` never matches and silently yields an empty string.
2. **`Last frame` is throttled and often never printed at all.** The progress interval widens as the trajectory gets longer (every frame → every 10 → …). On a long run the final update is simply skipped. Measured on a 2501-frame, 808 MB xtc: the last thing printed was `Reading frame 2000 time 40000.000`, no `Last frame` line was emitted, and **`gmx check` still exited 0**. The same parse worked on 14 other jobs in the same sweep — i.e. it fails for *some* inputs only, the worst failure mode there is.

**Fix / rule:** dump the final frame and read the time GROMACS stamps into the `.gro` **title line**, which is written unconditionally:

```bash
printf "System\n" | $GMX trjconv -s "$TPR" -f "$XTC" -o last.gro -dump 999999999
LAST_PS=$(head -1 last.gro | sed -n 's/.*t=[[:space:]]*\([0-9.eE+-]\{1,\}\).*/\1/p')
```
(`gmx check`'s `Item / #frames / Timestep` table is a second option, but `(n-1)×dt` assumes a uniform timestep and a `t=0` start, so it is strictly weaker.) Costs one pass over the trajectory — the same as `gmx check` would.

More generally: **never parse a GROMACS progress readout.** It is throttled, carriage-return drawn, and goes to stderr. Parse a file GROMACS wrote.

### Bash: a `[[ … ]] && echo` as the LAST line of a `set -e` script fails the job

Every engine sbatch runs under `set -euo pipefail` and ends with a block of summary
`echo`s. Writing a conditional one of those as `[[ -d "$DIR" ]] && echo "..."` is a trap:
when the test is false the compound command returns 1, and because it is the *last*
command the script exits 1 — SLURM then reports a fully successful run as **FAILED**.
(`set -e` does not fire on the test itself, since it is the left side of `&&`; the damage
is entirely in the exit status.)

**Fix / rule:** use a real `if` for conditional output near the end of a script, or append
`|| true`. The same applies to any `((counter++))` (returns 1 when the pre-increment value
is 0) or `grep -q` used as the final statement.

### Python packaging: setuptools flat-layout auto-discovery fails in this repo

`gromd_analysis/` sits at the repo root (flat layout, not `src/`). setuptools' automatic
package discovery refuses to guess when the root holds several candidate directories, and
this repo has `scripts/ example/ docs/ knowledgebase/ logs/` alongside the package. Without
an explicit declaration `pip install -e .` dies at build time with:

```
error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout: [...]
```

**Fix:** `pyproject.toml` declares the package explicitly — do not remove this stanza, and
add to it (rather than deleting it) if a second package is ever added:

```toml
[tool.setuptools]
packages = ["gromd_analysis"]
```

Flat layout was chosen deliberately over `src/`: it makes `PYTHONPATH=<repo root>` a working
no-install fallback on a node without network. `src/` would need `PYTHONPATH=<repo>/src`,
which is easier to get wrong. The tradeoff `src/` normally buys — guaranteeing tests run
against the *installed* package rather than the working copy — is worth nothing here, since
the install is always editable and never a published wheel.

Related: install with `pip install --no-deps -e .`. conda already provides
matplotlib/numpy/MDAnalysis/scikit-learn from `environment.yml`; letting pip resolve them
shadows the conda builds with wheels.

### GROMACS: there is no `pdb2gmx -ff list` — it reads `list` as a force-field name

`gmx_mpi pdb2gmx -f x.pdb -ff list` does **not** print the available force fields (that
form exists in some other tools' docs and in older tutorials). GROMACS 2024 looks for a
force field literally named `list` and dies:

```
Could not find force field 'list' in current directory, install tree or GMXLIB path.
```

— followed by an `MPI_ABORT` on an MPI build, which looks alarming for what is a typo-class
error. **Fix:** run `pdb2gmx` with **no** `-ff` and read the interactive menu, or list the
directories directly: `ls "$GMXLIB"/*.ff` plus `<build>/share/gromacs/top/*.ff`. The real
check that a force field resolves is a throwaway `pdb2gmx` run with `-ff <name>`; on
success it prints `Using the <Name> force field in directory <path>`.

### PLUMED/REST2: `partial_tempering` does NOT scale CHARMM CMAP — CHARMM + REST2 is silently wrong

`plumed partial_tempering` scales the solute Hamiltonian by rewriting the processed topology.
Measured on a real CHARMM36m topology (helix_fusion, 433 marked solute atoms), diffing the
λ=1.0 against the λ=0.5 topology, the sections it changes are:

```
151434  [ pairtypes ]
   865  [ dihedrals ]
   565  [ atomtypes ]
   433  [ atoms ]
   333  [ nonbond_params ]
```

`[ cmap ]` (41 entries) and `[ cmaptypes ]` (1475 entries) are **byte-identical between λ=1.0
and λ=0.5** — the script has no `cmap` handling at all (`grep -i cmap partial_tempering.sh`
returns nothing). CMAP is CHARMM's backbone φ/ψ cross-term correction and applies **only to the
protein**, i.e. exactly the hot region, so a CHARMM REST2 run scales charges, LJ and dihedrals
on the solute while leaving its backbone conformational term at full strength. The solute
Hamiltonian is only partially scaled, so the effective-temperature ladder is not the one the
run reports — and the term left unscaled is the one governing secondary-structure sampling,
which is usually the whole point of the run.

**Neither existing self-check catches it.** The λ=1.0 replica is still exact, so the
`scale=1.0 → P=1.0` sanity pair passes; exchanges still happen at nonzero rates, so the hrex
acceptance gate passes too. It looks like a healthy REST2 run.

AMBER force fields in this pipeline (`amber99sb-ildn`, `amber14sb`) have no CMAP, so the
existing REST2 path is unaffected. (Note `ff19SB` *does* use CMAP — same trap if it is ever
added.)

**Fix:** treat `FF=charmm*` as unsupported for REST2 and fail at STEP 1 rather than produce a
plausible-looking wrong ensemble. T-REMD and plain MD have no such restriction — they scale
nothing, so CHARMM is fully correct there. Lifting the restriction means teaching
`partial_tempering` to scale `[ cmap ]`/`[ cmaptypes ]` (or pre-scaling the CMAP grids per
replica), then re-validating.

Unrelated to the GROMACS build: the 2023.5 REST2 build finds `GMXLIB` and builds a CHARMM36m
topology fine (verified). The problem is the topology *scaling* step, not force-field access.

**Generalize this before adding any force field.** CHARMM is one instance of a class:
`partial_tempering` scales `[ atoms ] [ atomtypes ] [ nonbond_params ] [ pairtypes ] [ dihedrals ]`
and silently passes through everything else, so *any* force field with an extra conformational
term is affected — CMAP (CHARMM, AMBER ff19SB), polarization (Drude), tabulated torsions.
`docs/FORCE_FIELDS.md` carries the rule and a GPU-free per-force-field check (diff the λ=1.0 and
λ=0.5 topologies by section, then justify every unchanged section). Run it once per new force
field; the `charmm*` guard catches only the case we knew about.

**Now enforced by content, for every force field (2026-09-28):** STEP 7 runs
`scripts/simulation/check_rest2_topology.py` on `topol_rep000` vs the lowest-λ replica. It
checks the scaled *numbers* (hot charges ×√λ, hot ε ×λ, `[ nonbond_params ]`/`[ pairtypes ]`
×λ or ×√λ, torsion k ×√λ per hot end atom, bonds/angles untouched) and fails on any `[ cmap ]`,
`[ cmaptypes ]`, polarization or restraint section, or a `[ dihedrals ]` funct outside
{1,2,3,4,5,9}. On CHARMM36m it fails on exactly the two CMAP sections. The `charmm*` name check
stays as an early exit before any compute.

### GROMACS: restarting a density segment from a `.gro` silently loses the barostat's state

The iterative NPT density stage runs as a chain of fixed-length segments. REMD and REST2 used
to chain them with `grompp -c density_seg<N-1>.gro` and **no `-t`**; only MD passed the
checkpoint. That is not equivalent.

A `.gro` holds exactly three things: positions, velocities (at `%8.4f` nm/ps), and box vectors.
A `.cpt` additionally holds the **integrator's internal state** — the V-rescale thermostat
integral, the C-rescale barostat's box-scaling state, the RNG stream positions for both (both
are stochastic), the running pressure-coupling averages, and the step/time counter. Given only
`-c`, GROMACS resets all of that: `t=0`, `step=0`, fresh thermostat and barostat state, fresh
RNG.

Why it matters here specifically: **the barostat restarts cold at every segment boundary.** With
no saved state, C-rescale's first scaling decision is driven by the *instantaneous* virial
pressure, which fluctuates by several hundred bar in a solvated box — so each boundary gives the
volume a small random kick. That kick lands directly in the quantity the convergence loop is
measuring ("has the average volume stopped changing between segments?"), so part of the measured
change was a restart artifact rather than physics.

Two smaller consequences: `continuation = yes` is only strictly correct from a checkpoint (it
tells mdrun the input already satisfies the constraints, but `.gro` velocity rounding leaves them
satisfied only to ~1e-4, and `continuation = yes` tells mdrun not to fix it); and the time axis
restarts at 0 in every segment, so the per-segment `.edr`/`.xtc` cannot be concatenated into one
continuous trace.

**Fix:** every segment resumes with `-t "$LAST_CPT"`, and `LAST_CPT` is threaded through the loop
alongside `LAST_GRO`. Segment 1 resumes from `heat/heat.cpt`, which is why `HEAT_NS` must be `> 0`
in all three engines.

---

### GROMACS: `grompp -r` is the POSRES reference — a moving one lets the restraint ratchet

`define = -DPOSRES` activates the `[ position_restraints ]` block from `posre.itp`, putting a
harmonic spring (k = 1000 kJ/mol/nm² by default) on each protein heavy atom, pulling it toward a
**reference position**. Those reference positions come from `grompp -r`, *not* from `-c`.

All three density loops used to pass `-r "$LAST_GRO"` — the previous segment's output. So each
segment re-anchored the restraint to wherever the protein had already drifted. Within a segment
an atom sits in a harmonic well of width √(kT/k) ≈ 0.5 Å RMS, and wherever it drifted to became
the next segment's anchor.

The restraint therefore resists **per-segment** displacement but never **cumulative**
displacement. Random thermal excursions largely cancel (√N of something small). What does not
cancel is any *systematic* force — the force field preferring a slightly different backbone than
the designed pose. Against a fixed anchor the restraint balances that force; against a following
anchor there is nothing to balance it, and the drift accumulates linearly over 8–20 segments.

That matters for this project specifically, because RMSD-from-the-designed-pose is the headline
metric and the density stage was spending part of that drift budget before production started
and before the RMSD reference frame was set.

**Fix:** a fixed `POSRES_REF="${EM_DIR}/em.gro"` for every restrained stage in all three engines.
`refcoord-scaling = com` stays correct with a fixed reference — it scales the reference COM with
the box under the barostat without distorting internal geometry.

---

### Density convergence: a consecutive-segment difference does not detect a slow drift

The convergence test used to be `|V_n − V_{n−1}| / V_{n−1} <= DENSITY_TOL_REL`, evaluated once
`seg >= DENSITY_MIN_SEG`. For a solvated box the segment-to-segment noise is far below that
threshold — σ_V/V ≈ √(kT·κ/V) ≈ 2e-3 for a ~500 nm³ box, and the standard error of a 20 ps
segment mean is smaller still — so the test passes readily, **including while the box is still
shrinking steadily**. A sustained drift of 0.4 % per segment clears a 0.5 % threshold on every
single comparison while the box contracts ~3 % across the window.

**Fix:** `scripts/simulation/density_converged.py` fits a least-squares line through the trailing
`DENSITY_MIN_SEG` segments and requires the drift that line accounts for *across the window* to
be within tolerance. Random scatter has ~zero slope and still passes; a steady drift does not,
however small each step is. Scatter itself is deliberately **not** part of the test — it is the
physical volume fluctuation of an NPT box, not a sign of non-convergence. `parameters.txt` now
records whether the stage ended at a plateau or at the `DENSITY_MAX_SEG` cap.

---

### GROMACS: constraint-failure dumps (`step*.pdb`) land in the SUBMIT DIRECTORY, not `OUTDIR`

When LINCS/SETTLE reports an excessive deviation, `mdrun` writes a **pair** of PDBs —
`step<N>b.pdb` ("initial coordinates") and `step<N>c.pdb` ("coordinates after constraining")
— and logs `Wrote pdb files with previous and current coordinates`. Diffing the pair shows
which bond blew up, so they are genuinely useful.

The trap is **where** they go: GROMACS writes them to the process's **current working
directory**, which it has no flag to change. For an sbatch that is the *submit directory*.
So the files appear next to the submit scripts, nowhere near the `OUTDIR` of the job that
made them, and with no job ID in the name — on a shared submit dir you cannot tell which
run produced them.

They are also **full-system** PDBs. Measured on `example/input_pdbs/1a22-fixed.pdb`
(949 021 atoms): **75 MB each**, and EM alone dumped two pairs = 131 MB, dropped straight
onto the tight-quota pool that the whole `SYMLINK_BULK` folder-symlink model exists to keep
bulk *off*. A genuinely unstable run dumps far more.

Note this is **not** a sign that the new heat stage is unsafe: it fires during **energy
minimization** on strained input geometry (`1a22-fixed` does it reliably; `helix_fusion`
never does), EM recovers, and the run continues. The archived MD run on the same structure,
predating the heat-stage work, dumped identically.

**Fix:** each engine does `cd "${SCRATCH_DIR:-$OUTDIR}"` once, **immediately before the EM
step**, so dumps land where the bulk already goes. Safe because every path used after that
point is absolute; SLURM opens its `-o`/`-e` files relative to the submit dir *before* the
script body runs, so the job logs are unaffected; `$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR` is an env var; and
multi-replica `mdrun -multidir` chdirs each rank into its own rep dir regardless (so
per-replica stages were never affected — only the serial `em`/`heat`/`density` steps).

**The placement is load-bearing — this collides with the OUTDIR-filesystem gotcha above.**
Putting the `cd` earlier (right after the stage dirs are created, which is the obvious spot)
moves the cwd onto the scratch data volume *while `solvate`/`genion` are still running*, and
their topology `rename()` is fatal across filesystems. Measured: the build dies 8 s in with
`[ERROR] Failed at step 3` in `Solvating…`. During the build the cwd must stay on the same
filesystem as the topology; every `mdrun` runs at or after EM, so just before EM is both late
enough to be safe and early enough to catch every dump.

**If you find stray `step*.pdb` next to the submit scripts,** they are from a run predating
this fix. They are pure debug output and safe to delete once you no longer need the diff.

**Moving them to scratch creates a second problem: nobody browses scratch.** A run that threw
constraint failures and then finished would look perfectly clean, and — worse — a run that
*failed* before `PRESERVE_FROM_STEP` would have its scratch cleaned by the ERR trap, deleting
the very files needed to explain the failure. That is strictly worse than the old behaviour,
where the dumps at least survived in the submit dir. Both halves are handled:

- `report_crash_dumps.sh DUMP_DIR OUTDIR` runs at the end of every job. The bulky PDBs stay on
  scratch; a small `OUTDIR/CONSTRAINT_FAILURES.txt` (count, which stage's log logged them, full
  paths, and how to diff a b/c pair) plus a banner in the job log land where people actually
  look. It deletes a stale report when a run is clean, so the file's presence always means
  *this* run. Always exits 0 — diagnostics must never fail a good job.
- On failure the ERR trap writes the report **before** cleaning, passing `deleted` so the report
  says plainly that the PDBs went with the scratch dir and that `PRESERVE_SCRATCH_FROM=always`
  would have kept them. The few-KB record survives in `OUTDIR` either way.

**`PRESERVE_SCRATCH_FROM` is NOT overridden when dumps exist** — an earlier version of this fix
did that, and it was wrong twice over. `never` has to mean never; and because a strained
structure dumps during EM on *every* run (`1a22-fixed` does), "keep scratch whenever dumps
exist" would silently disable the knob for that entire class of input and leave the whole
multi-GB `density/equil/prod` tree behind, not just the 750 MB of dumps. The split is: the
policy governs the bulky PDBs, the cheap metadata always survives in `OUTDIR`.

**Reading the report:** dumps from `em/` are common and usually benign — strained input geometry
that EM then recovers from (`1a22-fixed` does it every run; `helix_fusion` never does). Dumps
from `heat/`, `density/` or production mean a simulation going unstable and deserve a look.

### GROMACS: `pdb2gmx -water` only accepts built-in names, and `solvate` needs a box with the model's site count

`pdb2gmx -water` is an enumerated option (`select none spc spce tip3p tip4p tip4pew tip5p
tips3p`), not a lookup into the force field's `watermodels.dat`. A force-field-specific water —
a99SB-disp's `a99SBdisp_water` — fails at the command-line parser:

```
Invalid command-line options
  In command-line option -water
    Invalid value: a99SBdisp_water
```

The model can only be chosen through `-water select`, answering the menu (which lists
`watermodels.dat` in file order, 1-based, then "None") on stdin. Because a menu number could
silently pick the wrong model if the file changed, confirm the result: the topology must
`#include ".../<WATER>.itp"`.

Separately, the engine used to solvate with a hardcoded `spc216.gro`. That is a 3-site box: a
4-site water (TIP4P-Ew, TIP4P-D, `a99SBdisp_water`, OPC) then has 3 atoms per molecule in the
`.gro` and 4 in the topology — a fatal grompp mismatch at best. The box must match the model's
site count (`tip4p.gro` for 4-site, `tip5p.gro` for 5-site), or be the force field's own
`<WATER>.gro` if it ships one (a99SB-disp does; its atom names `OW HW2 HW3 MW4` match its
`.itp`, where GROMACS's `tip4p.gro` says `OW HW1 HW2 MW` and grompp warns about 3 non-matching
names per water — harmless but noisy). The a99SB-disp box upstream once had vacuum gaps (issue
#1, fixed; the current one is a clean 7.5 nm cube).

**Fix:** `scripts/simulation/resolve_water.py FF WATER <GMXLIB dirs> $GMXDATA/top` runs at
STEP 1 (so a bad `WATER` fails before any compute) and prints the `-water` argument, the menu
answer, the site count and the box; STEP 3 uses them and checks the `#include`. 3-site built-ins
resolve to exactly the old `-water <WATER>` + `spc216.gro` (verified: an amber99sb-ildn/TIP3P
pilot's `processed.top`/`topol_rep*.top` rebuild identically).

### GROMACS: an input PDB with `CYX` residue names gets NO disulfide bonds from `pdb2gmx`

`pdb2gmx` finds disulfides with `specbond.dat` (`CYS SG 1 CYS SG 1 0.2 CYX CYX`): it matches
residues **named `CYS`** whose SG atoms are within 0.2 nm, links them, and renames them `CYX`.
A residue that is already called `CYX` in the input — as tleap writes it, and as many
Amber-prepared PDBs have it — does not match, so the bond is silently not made: no
"Linking CYS-… and CYS-…" line in the log, the SG atoms carry the `CYX` template (no HG) but are
not bonded to each other, and a simulation lets them drift apart. Found while cross-checking
a99SB-disp against sander: the GROMACS bond energy was fine, but the Amber topology (which had
the S–S bond) blew up to 3×10⁵ kcal/mol on the GROMACS frames.

**Fix:** feed `pdb2gmx` `CYS`, never `CYX`, and check the log for one `Linking` line per
disulfide. The engine's inputs so far (e.g. `gp130_218-Y_binder_only.pdb`) use `CYS`.

### Validating a GROMACS AMBER-family port against tleap: tleap is not automatically the ground truth

When a GROMACS port and an Amber build of "the same" force field disagree, find the term
before blaming the port. Two things seen validating a99SB-disp (`docs/FORCE_FIELDS.md`,
validation record):

- **tleap added a generic torsion on top of a specific one.** For serine `OG-CB-CA-C` the
  frcmod has both the specific `C-CT-C8-OH` (1-fold) and the wildcard `X-CT-C8-X` (3-fold).
  Amber and viparr rules say the exact match replaces the wildcard; tleap nevertheless emitted
  both terms for 8 of the 9 serines in gp130 (the ninth, and the serine in a test peptide,
  got only the specific term — same atom types, so the trigger is not the typing), up to
  1.3 kJ/mol each.
  The GROMACS port and the Desmond definition have the specific term only. Judge against the
  force field's definitive source (here the authors' Desmond files), not against whichever
  implementation you happen to trust.
- **Stock GROMACS `amber99sb-ildn` has a constant torsion offset vs tleap `ff99SBildn`**
  (−74.64 kJ/mol on a 23-residue peptide, identical in every frame). A constant changes no
  force and cancels in the exchange criterion; it is a representation difference, not a bug.
  Look at the *spread* of a difference across frames, not its mean.

Compare per torsion as a *function of φ*, not term by term: Amber stores some a99SB-disp
torsions with arbitrary phases (e.g. 50.05°) while the GROMACS port expands them into 0°/90°
cosine/sine terms plus a constant — equal functions, different parameter lists.

### PLUMED/REST2: on GPU, hrex exchange energies carry ~0.37 kT of random noise — identical replicas accept only ~80%

Two replicas with **identical** Hamiltonians (`TEMPS_LIST="300,300"`, both λ = 1.000000) must
exchange with probability exactly 1: the REST2 criterion is a difference of energies of the
same configurations under the same topology. On the engine's GPU path (`-nb gpu -pme gpu
-bonded gpu`) they accepted **84%** (a99SB-disp) and **80%** (amber99sb-ildn/TIP3P) of swaps
over 50 attempts. The exchange block in `rest2.log` shows where it comes from:

```
Repl 0 <-> 1  dE_term = -0.000e+00 (kT)     GROMACS' own term: exactly 0
  dpV = -0.000e+00  d =  0.000e+00           pressure-volume term: exactly 0
dplumed =  3.007e-01  dE_Term =  3.007e-01 (kT)   PLUMED's re-evaluated energies: NOT 0
Repl pr   .74
```

`dplumed` over 50 attempts: mean 0.009 kT (zero within error), **sd 0.36–0.38 kT** for both
force fields. Rerunning the **same tprs on CPU** (`-nb cpu -pme cpu -bonded cpu`): `dplumed`
exactly 0 on every attempt, P = 1.0 on 25/25. With `-nb gpu -pme cpu` the noise stays (sd
0.39 kT), so it is the **GPU nonbonded kernel**: its energy accumulation order is
non-deterministic, so the same configuration evaluates to a slightly different energy each
time (~3 ppm of a −1.2×10⁵ kT total), and hrex compares energies from separate evaluations.
(`-nb cpu -pme gpu` is not a valid combination.) The original REST2 validation
(`knowledgebase/plans/REST2-pipeline.md`) was CPU-only, which is why P = 1.0 was seen there.

**What it means:** every exchange on a real ladder is decided with ~0.37 kT of zero-mean random
error added to Δ. That lowers acceptance a little and — because noise enters the Metropolis
test non-linearly — slightly violates detailed balance (order σ²/2 ≈ 0.07 kT in the exchange
weights). It is **not force-field-specific** and applies to **every GPU REST2 run so far**,
including the amber99sb-ildn pilot. The STEP 11 gate does not see it (it only requires a
nonzero rate).

**Options** (decision pending, 2026-09-28): accept and quote it as a known small bias; or run
REST2 fully on CPU (exact; measured 97 ns/day per replica at 8 cores/replica on gp130 in
a99SB-disp water vs 162 ns/day/replica for the 24-replica, 1-GPU GPU pilot). **Diagnose it on
any new setup with an identical-λ run and read the `dplumed` lines, not just the acceptance.**

### Python packaging: a NEW `gromd-*` entry point is not installed until you re-run `pip install -e .`

An editable install (`pip install -e . --no-deps`) links the package *code* live, but the
console-script wrappers in `$CONDA_PREFIX/bin` are generated only at install time. When
`gromd-roundtrip` was added to `pyproject.toml` (commit "added round trips"), `groMD_env` was
never reinstalled, so every job since logged only

```
run_analysis.sh: line 89: gromd-roundtrip: command not found
[WARN] gromd-roundtrip failed — re-run the command above
```

and finished "successfully" with no replica-mixing report — including all REST2 campaigns run
after that commit. The other tools worked because their wrappers predate it.

**Fix:** after adding or renaming a `[project.scripts]` entry, run
`pip install -e . --no-deps` in `groMD_env` (done 2026-09-28), and check with
`which gromd-<name>`. Old jobs can be backfilled with `gromd-roundtrip OUTDIR --plot`.
